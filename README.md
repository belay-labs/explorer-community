## Roadmap

This tool was built to unblock our own experimentation and product research with GPT-3. As our own experimentation process develops, we'll continue to add features to Explorer so we can augment our own explorations, and hopefully the rest of the community's.

Check out our [public roadmap](https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer/projects) to see what's upcoming for Explorer!

## Maintainers
Hi! We're [Cathy](https://github.com/cathykc), [Stedman](https://github.com/stedmanblake), and [Zain](https://github.com/tarzain). We initially built this as a small internal tool and thought it'd be useful to others as they explore GPT-3 usecases. Feel free to DM us in the OpenAI Slack or email us at hello@belaylabs.com! üëã
